          Reading Book: Whenever I have leisure time, I usually spend my time
          reading my favourite books. The books are usually about
          self-improvement since it helps readers live a successful life by
          guiding them the way to achieve their ambition. Sometimes, I also read
          light novels as a way to help me entertain after being under the
          pressure of studying. My favourite book of all the time is “How to Win
          Friends and Influence People” of the famous author, Dale Carnegie. The
          book focuses on teaching me the skills as well as the primary
          principles of communication in order to be able to influence the
          others.

          Listening to music: I also choose to listen to music as an effective
          method of not only relaxing my mind but focusing on my tasks as well.

        <li>
          Self-learning: Whenever I feel bored or do not know what to do, I
          often spend my time finding new objectives to learn. Sometimes, I
          learn how an application is implemented by decompiling the source code
          of the software and read its structure. I also modify the
          functionalities of the application so that it could fit my purpose. I
          choose the method of finding an objective and then implementing an
          application to accomplish it as a way to for me to practice and learn
          new knowledge.

            <li><a>Project:</a> Smart Nutrition Monitoring</li>
            <li><a>Description:</a> Many researchers have attempted to develop nutrition monitoring system using
              wearable sensor devices. The main advantage of this approach is removing the burden of self-report.
              Although there are several studies to adopt these sensors to monitor food intake, most of them have been
              tested in laboratory conditions for limited number of participants. Moreover, almost all of them are based
              on a single sensor, which limits the accuracy of data collection and consequently data reliability. The
              average accuracy for nutrition intake using these sensors is about 90% in the laboratory environments. So,
              an open challenge is to find a non-invasive solution to monitor nutrition intake in real-life scenarios
              with a high degree of accuracy, which is the goal of this research project.</li>
